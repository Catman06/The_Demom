text = "You woke in the middle of the night to a disturbing crunching noise. You sneak to the master bedroom where your parents sleep and discover your mother has been possessed and driven insane by Cennin, the demon of Chaos, and has killed your father! Terrified, you sneak down to the living room and almost make it out the door before you remember that your mother, though now insane, didn’t raise a coward. You are filled with determination to exorcise the demon and save the day! How hard could that be? 
To save your mother and purge the demon, you’ll need a few key items to help with the exorcism. You will need your father’s [b]demonology book[/b] from the study as a reference for the ritual, a [b]family photo[/b] from the hallway and your [b]grandmother's necklace[/b] from your bedroom to use as personal items to help strengthen your connection with your mother in the ritual, a [b]hand mirror[/b] in the bathroom to trap the demon in, [b]salt[/b] from the pantry to create a circle around the mirror to prevent the demon from escaping, and the [b]meat tenderizer[/b] from the kitchen to destroy the mirror and Cennin once and for all!"
